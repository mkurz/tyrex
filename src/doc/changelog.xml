  logging and performance monitoring in package tyrex.tools.

- Added TransactionDomain. Multiple transaction monitors are now
  supported each running within its own transaction domain, where all

  interceptors. Most of the functionality of TransactionServer has now
  been placed in TransactionDomain.

  the interfaces for resource limits, resource pool and resouce pool
  manager to be used across Tyrex.
