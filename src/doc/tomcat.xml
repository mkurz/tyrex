<p>
Tomcat only supports tyrex.resource.jdbc.xa.EnabledDataSource which means that JDBC data sources are not supported and there is limited connection pool support. EnabledDataSource only supports JDBC 1.1 connections.
</p><p>
You can set the following EnabledDataSource parameters: user, password, driverClassName, driverName.
Missing parameters are: pruneFactor (for reducing the size of pooled connections), isolationLevel and transactionTimeout.
</p>
<p> 
To use the Tyrex connection pools you will have to integrate them with Tomcat yourself.
