    <section title="About">
      
      <p>Bugzilla is a CGI-based bug tracking system that is part of the
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> distribution. It has a web-based front end
        for submitting bugs and querying the bug database.</p>
      
      <p>The bugzilla URL for Tyrex and other ExoLab projects is located <a href="http://bugzilla.exolab.org">here</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Once you're at the front page you are presented with options to submit a bug or query
        the database or take some other action. Whenever you are asked for the project always
        select <b>Tyrex</b> to get the Tyrex related bugs.</p>
