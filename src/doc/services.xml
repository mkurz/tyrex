    <section title="Clock and UUID">
    
      <p><api>tyrex.services.Clock</api> provides an efficient mechanism for
        obtaining the current system time. It uses a background thread to automatically
        increment an internal clock and periodically synchronize with the system clock.
        The method <tt>tyrex.services.Clock.clock()</tt> is more efficient than
        <tt>java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis()</tt> and also allows the clock to be
        artificially advanced for testing purposes.</p>

      <p><api>tyrex.services.UUID</api> is a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)
        generator. A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time,
        with respect to the space of all UUIDs. A UUID can be used for objects with
        an extremely short lifetime, and to reliably identifying very persistent
        objects across a network. UUIDs are 128 bit values and encoded as 36 character
        identifiers.</p>

      <p>This generator produces time-based UUIDs based on the varient specified in a
        February 4, 1998 IETF draft. Identifiers can be created in string form with and
        without a prefix, and as byte arrays. Convenience methods are also provided for
        converting an identifier to and from an array of bytes.</p>

      <p><api>tryex.services.DaemonMaster</api> is responsible for starting,
        terminating and restarting daemon thread. A daemon thread is a thread that
        is kept live for the duration of the server's life and is only terminated
        when the server is stopped. The daemon master protects the system from the
        sudden and unexpected termination of daemons by automatically restarting them.</p>
