  <!-- description of contributor types -->

  <type name="Committer">
    Committers are contributors who have written lots of important code,
    sacrificing all social events, and becoming a hermit at the expense
    of providing good tools for people they don't even know. In return for
    their love and devotion you may bug them with questions, bug fixes,
    patches and offer them free beer.
  </type>

  <type name="Contributor">
    Contributors are responsible for making this a better project and
    we all end up benefiting from the bug fixes, design changees or features
    they contributed. Contributors tend to live a balanced life and
    hopefully eat a healthy diet.
  </type>

  <type name="Documentor">
    Documentors do the impossible and actually explain how to use the
    software in spite of all the complexity introduced by the committers
    and contributors.
  </type>

  <type name="Feedback">
    The following have offered valuable feedback (including bug reports) that has been beneficial
    to the development and stability.
