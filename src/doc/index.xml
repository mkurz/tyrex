        services for security and authentication, local and distributed transactions,
        resource configuration and pooling, and TP monitoring.</p>

    <section title="About Tyrex">
      
      <p>Tyrex is the missing piece in the J2EE puzzle, the hidden back end behind the
        Servlet, EJB and JMS servers. Due to its nature as a back-end system, Tyrex is probably one of the most boring
        open source projects on earth.</p>
      
      <p>Most of the code released in Tyrex has been developed by Assaf Arkin. Contributors are welcome
        to join this project. Please join us on the <a href="lists.xml">mailing list</a>.</p>
