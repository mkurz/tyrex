  <title>Container Principal And Credentials</title>

  <body>
    <p>Principal and credentials used by a J2EE container. These principals and
       credentials are created by a JAAS login module and exposed to the application
       through the Servlet and EJB APIs in the form of the principal and list of roles.</p>

    <p>{@link RealmPrincipal} represents a J2EE principal. The principal name is equivalent
       to the account and can be used to access entities associated with that user.
       The container may use the realm to distinguish users of the same principal name
       accessing different realms.</p>

    <p>{@link RoleCredentials} represents a J2EE credential listing all the roles of
       which the principal is a member. The container may determine whether the principal
       is a member of a particular role, or list all the role names.</p>

    <p>{@link SecureConnection} represents a secure connection between client and server,
       allowing the application to establish that it is being accessed in a secure
       fashion. This credential is exposed to the application through the <tt>isSecure</tt>
       method in the Servlet API.</p>
