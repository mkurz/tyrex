  <title>Authentication API</title>
  <body>
    <p>Implements a subset of the JAAS API for Java 1.2.2 support.</p>

    <p><tt>Subject</tt> is a JAAS-like class that does not depend on the Java 1.3 run time.
       Since the JAAS <tt>Subject</tt> is a final class, using this class requires using
       the supplied <tt>LoginModule</tt> and <tt>LoginContext</tt>. Compatibility with the
       JAAS API means that code written using these classes is portable to JAAS.</p>
