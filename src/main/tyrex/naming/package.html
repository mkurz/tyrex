    <p>An in-memory namespace is available through the {@link tyrex.naming.MemoryContext}
       JNDI service provider. The in-memory namespace holds objects directly in memory
       including factories and services that cannot be held in a persistent namespace.
       It supports two modes of operation, a tree shared between all instances through
       a shared namespace, and trees created dynamically with access controlled by their
       creator. See <a href="#memory">In-Memory Context</a> for more details.</p>

    <p>The in-memory JNDI service provider has the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is held entirely in memory for fast access and manipulations</li>
      <li>It is persisted indirectly through copying to XML files or persistent
        JNDI namespaces (e.g. LDAP, CosNaming, etc)</li>
      <li>It supports binding of persistent (serializable and referenceable),
          remote (RMI/IIOP) and active objects (resource factories, services, etc).</li>
      <li>It is a full JNDI service provider supporting sub-context creation and
          destruction, lookup and name parsing, heirarchial structure, links, etc.</li>
      <li>It provides the basis for the JNDI Environment Naming Context</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The caller must had adequate security permission to access the shared in-memory
       namespace (creating a private namespace requires no permission) and to set/unset
       the ENC for the current thread, see <a href="#permissions">Access Permissions</a>
       for more details.</p>

    <h3><a name="memory">In-Memory Context</a></h3>

    <p>{@link tyrex.naming.MemoryContext} is an in-memory JNDI service provider. It binds
       objects into a namespace held entirely in memory, supporting serializable, remoteable
       and local objects. The in-memory service provider is particularly useful for holding
       resource factories (the JNDI ENC) and exposing run-time services and configuration objects.</p>

    <p>An instance of {@link MemoryContext} constructed with no environment attribute will use
       it's own tree of bindings. Such a tree is no accessible except through context created from
       the original context, and is garbage collected when all such contexts are no longer referenced.
       If necessary the root context can be duplicated using <tt>lookup( "" )</tt>.</p>

    <p>If the environment attribute {@link Context.PROVIDER_URL} is used, the context will reference
       a node in a tree shared by all such contexts. That tree is statically held in memory for the
       life time of the virtual machine.</p>

    <p>{@link tyrex.naming.MemoryContextFactory} implements a context factory for {@link MemoryContext}.
       When set properly {@link javax.naming.InitialContext} will return a {@link MemoryContext}
       referencing the named path in the memory model. Typically applications will use it to
       construct an in-memory namespace under the shared root, e.g.:</p>

    <pre>
MemoryContextFactory factory;
Hashtable            env;

<font color="red">// Set up the path</font>
env = new Hashtable();
env.put( Context.PROVIDER_URL, "services" );
<font color="red">// Obtain the context for services</font>
factory = new MemoryContextFactory();
ctx = factory.getInitialContext( env );

<font color="red">// Alternatively, construct MemoryContext directly</font>

env = new Hashtable();
env.put( Context.PROVIDER_URL, "services" );
ctx = new MemoryContext( env );
    </pre>

    <h3><a name="enc">Environment Naming Context</a></h3>

    <p>{@link tyrex.naming.java.javaURLContextFactory} implements a URL context factory for
       the <tt>java:</tt> URL. It exposes <tt>java:/comp</tt> as a read-only context as per
       the J2EE container requirements. To use this context factory the JNDI properties file
       must include the following property: <tt>java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=tyrex.naming</tt>.</p>

    <h3><a name="permissions">Access Permissions</a></h3>

    <p>{@link tyrex.naming.NamingPermission} defines the permissions required to read/write
       the shared in-memory namespace and set/unset the environment naming context for a thread.
       The following permissions are defined:</p>
    <dl>
      <dd>tyrex.naming.NamingPermission "shared"</dd>
      <dt>Access (read/write) to the shared in-memory namespace</dt>
      <dd>tyrex.naming.NamingPermission "enc"</dd>
      <dt>Access (read/write) to the environment naming context
        and ability to set/unset it for the current thread</dt>
    </dl>
