    <h2>Clock and UUID</h2>

    <p>{@link tyrex.services.Clock} provides an efficient mechanism for obtaining the current
       time and date. Uses a background thread to automatically increment an internal clock and
       periodically synchronize with the system clock. The method {@link tyrex.services.Clock#clock
       clock} is more efficient than {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis currentTimeMillis}
       and also allows the clock to be artificially advanced for testing purposes.</p>

    <p>{@link tyrex.services.UUID} is a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) generator.
       A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to
       the space of all UUIDs. A UUID can be used for objects with an extremely short lifetime,
       and to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network. UUIDs are 128 bit
       values and encoded into 36 characters.</p>

    <p>This generator produces time-based UUIDs based on the varient specified in an IETF draft
       from February 4, 1998. Identifiers can be created in string form with and without a prefix,
      and as byte arrays. Convenience methods are also provided for converting an identifier to
      and from an array of bytes.</p>
