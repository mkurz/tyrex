    <h2>Clock and UUID</h2>

    <p>{@link tyrex.services.Clock} provides an efficient mechanism for obtaining the current
       time and date. Uses a background thread to automatically increment an internal clock and
       periodically synchronize with the system clock. The method {@link tyrex.services.Clock#clock
       clock} method is more efficient than {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis currentTimeMillis}
       and also allows the clock to be artificially advanced for testing purposes.</p>

    <p>{@link tyrex.services.UUID} is a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) generator.
       A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to
       the space of all UUIDs. A UUID can be used for objects with an extremely short lifetime,
       and to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network. UUIDs are 128 bit
       values and encoded into 36 characters.</p>

    <p>This generator produces time-based UUIDs based on the varient specified in an IETF draft
       from February 4, 1998. Unprefixed identifiers are generated by calling {@link 
       tyrex.services.UUID#create() create}. A method is also provided to create prefixed
       identifiers. Prefixed identifiers are useful for logging and associating identifiers
       to application objects.</p>

    <p>Convenience methods are also provided for converting an identifier to and from an array
       of bytes. The conversion methods assume that the identifier is a prefixed or unprefixed
       encoding of the byte array as pairs of hexadecimal digits.</p>
