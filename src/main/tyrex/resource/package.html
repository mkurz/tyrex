    <p>{@link tyrex.resource.Resource} represents an installed resource. An installed resource
      has a client factory that is made available to the application, typically for JNDI,
      allowing it to create new connections. The client factory type depends on the type of
      resource in use.</p>

    <p>An installed resource has a connection pool that manages utilization of the resource.
      The connection pool metrics can be obtained from {@link tyrex.resource.PoolMetrics}.
      This object records usage metrics for the connection pool, recording such information as
      the accumulated number of connections created and used, the average time a connection
      is used by the application or held in the pool, etc.</p>

    <p>{@link tyrex.resource.ResourceLimits} represents limits placed on a resource. The limits
      are read from the configuration file and apply to the connection pool.</p>

    <p>{@link tyrex.resource.Resources} represents a collection of installed resources.
      Resources are obtained from this collection by the name with which they were installed.</p>

    <p>The deployment process uses the methods {@link tyrex.resource.Resources#addConfiguration
      addConfiguration} and {@link tyrex.resource.Resources#listConfigurations listConfigurations}
      to add and list resource configurations.</p>

    <p>The application server uses the methods {@link tyrex.resource.Resources#listResources} and
      {@link tyrex.resource.Resources#getResource getResource} to obtain resources and make the client
      connection factory available to the application.</p>
