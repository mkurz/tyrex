    <h2>Transaction Domains</h2>

    <p>A transaction domain provides centralized management for transactions.
      Transaction domains are created by and obtained from {@link tyrex.tm.TransactionDomain}.</p>

    <p>A transaction domain defines the policy for all transactions created from that domain,
      such as default timeout, maximum number of open transactions, IIOP support, and journaling.</p>
    
    <p>The application server obtains a transaction manager or user transaction object, and
      managed resources from the transaction domain.</p>

    <p>Transaction domains are created from a domain configuration file. For more information about
      domain configuration files, refer to the relevant documentation and <tt>domain.xsd</tt>.</p>

    <p>Usage metrics for transactions can be obtained from {@link tyrex.tm.DomainMetrics}.
      Usage metrics include information such as the accumulated number of transactions committed
      and rolledback, the average duration of a transaction, etc.</p>

    <p>Transaction domains support interceptors that allow an external engine to hook up into
     the transaction monitor and either record the outcome of transactions or affect them.</p>


    <h2>JTA Extended Interfaces</h2>

    <p>All Tyrex transactions implement the interface {@link tyrex.tm.TyrexTransaction},  which
      supports asynchronous commit and rollback, and one phase commit. Asynchronous transaction
      commit and rollback can use the {@link tyrex.tm.AsyncCompletionCallback} interface.</p>

    <p>All Tyrex transaction managed implement the interface {@link tyrex.tm.TyrexTransactionManager},
      which supports transaction resolving from an Xid, and means to obtain extended transaction status.
      Extended transaction status information is returned by {@link tyrex.tm.TyrexTransactionStatus}.</p>
