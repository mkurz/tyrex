    <h2>Transaction Domains</h2>

    <p>A transaction domain provides centralized management for transactions. A transaction domain
      defines the policy for all transactions created from that domain, such as default timeout,
      maximum number of open transactions, IIOP support, and journaling. In addition, the domain
      maintains resource managers such as JDBC data sources and JCA connectors.</p>

    <p>The application server obtains a transaction manager or user transaction object, and
      managed resources from the transaction domain.</p>

    <p>Transaction domains are created from a domain configuration file. For more information about
      domain configuration files, refer to the relevant documentation and <tt>domain.xsd</tt>.</p>

    <p>Usage metrics for transactions can be obtained from {@link tyrex.tm.DomainMetrics}.
      Usage metrics include information such as the accumulated number of transactions committed
      and rolledback, the average duration of a transaction, etc.</p>

    <p>The following code illustrates how to create a new transaction domain:
<pre>
InputStream       stream;
TransactionDomain domain;

<font color="ref">// Create a transaction domain using a domain configuration file</font>
stream = new FileInputStream( "domain.xml" )
try {
    domain = TransactionDomain.createDomain( stream );
} catch ( DomainConfigurationException except ) {
    <font color="ref">// Domain cannot be created, handle error</font>
    . . . 
}
<font color="ref">// Recover all resources used in the domain</font>
try {
    domain.recover();
} catch ( RecoveryException except ) {
    <font color="ref">// Ignore all errors, they are logged to the console.</font>
}
<font color="ref">// Domain is now active and ready to use</font>
</pre></p>


    <h2>The Runtime Context</h2>

    <p>The runtime context provides an association between a component or client, the current thread,
      and resources used by the application.</p>

    <p>The runtime context keeps track of active transaction, JNDI ENC, security subject, and open
      connections. It is associated with a component or client, and can be preserved across method
      invocations by associating it with the current thread.</p>

    <p>Each thread is associated with a runtime context, whether explicitly or implicitly. A thread can
      be associated with a particular runtime context by calling {@link tyrex.tm.RuntimeContext#setRuntimeContext
      setRuntimeContext}. If this method was not called, a default runtime context is created on demand.</p>

    <p>A new runtime context can be created with one of the {@link tyrex.tm.RuntimeContext#newRuntimeContext
      newRuntimeContext} methods and populated with JNDI bindings and security context. The runtime context
      is then associated with the current thread across method invocations belonging to the same component
      or client.</p>

    <p>The runtime context keeps track of the current active transaction. When the runtime context is
      associated with the current thread, this is the same transaction available from <tt>TransactionManager</tt>.</p>

    <p>The runtime context keeps track of the JNDI environment naming context. The JNDI bindings are accessible
      from the <tt>java:</tt> URL when the runtime context is associated with the current thread.</p>

    <p>The runtime context keeps track of the security subject used for authentication and authorization when
      the runtime context is associated with the current thread.</p>

    <p>The runtime context keeps track of all connections obtained from the environment naming context.
      Open connections can be retained across method invocations.</p>

    <p>The following example illustrates how to create and use a runtime context:
<pre>
RuntimeContext runCtx;
Context        jndiCtx;
Resources      resources;
DataSource     dataSource;

<font color="ref">// Create a new context</font>
runCtx = RuntimeContext.newRuntimeContext();

<font color="ref">// Bind a JDBC DataSource to the JNDI ENC</font>
jndiCtx = runCtx.getEnvContext().createSubcontext( "jdbc" );
resources = TransactionDomain.getDomain( "myDomain" ).getResources();
dataSource = (DataSource) resources.getResource( "dataSource" );
jndiCtx.bind( "myDB", dataSource );

. . .
<font color="ref">// Associate the runtime context with the current thread</font>
RuntimeContext.setRuntimeContext( runCtx );

. . .
<font color="ref">// Dissociate the runtime context with the current thread</font>
RuntimeContext.unsetRuntimeContext();

. . .
<font color="ref">// Discard the runtime context</font>
runCtx.cleanup();
</pre></p>


    <h2>JTA Extended Interfaces</h2>

    <p>All Tyrex transactions implement the interface {@link tyrex.tm.TyrexTransaction}, which
      supports asynchronous commit and rollback, and one phase commit.</p>

    <p>All Tyrex transaction managed implement the interface {@link tyrex.tm.TyrexTransactionManager},
      which supports transaction resolving from an Xid, and means to obtain extended transaction status.</p>

    <p>{@link tyrex.tm.TransactionStatus} provide additional information about a transaction in addition
      to that provided by <tt>Transaction</tt>, including the transaction identifier (Xid), start time
      and timeout, resources and thread association.</p>

    <p>Interceptors allow an external engine to hook up into the transaction monitor and either record
      the outcome of transactions or affect them. The interceptor is notified when transactions are
      created, attempt to commit, rolled back, and when they are resumed or suspended from threads.</p>


    <h2>Journaling</h2>

    <p>Transaction journal is an external service not provided by Tyrex. The {@link tyrex.tm.Journal}
      interface is used to link Tyrex into an implementation of a transaction journal.</p>
