Security Policy For Tyrex
-------------------------

Tyrex certain security permissions that are required by an application
server, or one of its components, to perform certain operations on the
transaction server.

General application access to the transaction server through the
UserTransaction interface does not require any specific permissions.

The following permissions are defined and should exist in the
security policy of the application server or any other component
interacting with the transaction server:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Start the transaction server               | server.start          |
|                                            |                       |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Shutdown the transaction server            | server.shutdown       |
|                                            |                       |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Run a meter against the transaction server | server.meter          |
|                                            |                       |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Terminate an arbitrary transaction         | transaction.terminate |
|                                            |                       |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Obtain information about an arbitrary      | transaction.list      |
| transaction or list all transactions       |                       |
|                                            |                       |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Use the TransactionManager interface to    | transaction.manager   |
| manage transactions                        |                       |
|                                            |                       |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to terminate the thread associated with a terminated
transaction, the RuntimePermission "stopThread" must also be present.


The following permissions would be granted to the application server
or components that control the transaction manager and manage
transactions on behalf of the application:

grant codebase "file:/appServer/-" {
    permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "stopThread"
    permission tyrex.server.TransactionServerPermission "server.start"
    permission tyrex.server.TransactionServerPermission "server.shutdown"
    permission tyrex.server.TransactionServerPermission "transaction.manager"
};

The following permissions would be granted to an administration tool
reporting about transactions and metering the server:

grant codebase "file:/reportTool/-" {
  permission tyrex.server.TransactionServerPermission "server.meter"
  permission tyrex.server.TransactionServerPermission "transaction.list"
};

The following permissions would be granted to a management thread
responsible to terminate transactions, e.g. at the event of losing
connection with the client:

grant codebase "file:/reportTool/-" {
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "stopThread"
  permission tyrex.server.TransactionServerPermission "transaction.list"
  permission tyrex.server.TransactionServerPermission "transaction.terminate"
};
