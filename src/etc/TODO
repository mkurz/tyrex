- Make UserTransactionImpl serializable by looking up
  the transaction domain upon de-serialization.

- Need to validate that both TransactionManager and TransactionFactory
  provide the proper timeout in seconds.

- OTS requires other mechanism to bypass thread owner check

- Separate method for recovery of transaction domain, allowing resources to be added
  after domain has been created and participate in recovery sequence

- Implement shutdown for transaction domain and connection pool

- Add ThreadPool implementation with ThreadPoolMetrics for statistics (including average
  execution time, average block time, block/unblock ratio)

- ThreadPool to use Runnable but add stop() method

- Have all asynch transactions complete in background thread of TransactionDomain

- Finish JCA connection pool and provide optional code building in build.xml

- Revise src/doc/library.xml
