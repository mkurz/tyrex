- Make UserTransactionImpl serializable by looking up
  the transaction domain upon de-serialization.

- Need to validate that both TransactionManager and TransactionFactory
  provide the proper timeout in seconds.

- Implement shutdown for transaction domain and connection pool

- Add ThreadPool implementation with ThreadPoolMetrics for statistics (including average
  execution time, average block time, block/unblock ratio)

- ThreadPool to use Runnable but add stop() method

- Have all asynch transactions complete in background thread of TransactionDomain
